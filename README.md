# Boolean Function Minimizer

## Overview

This C++ application is designed to minimize Boolean functions represented by minterms, maxterms, and don't-care terms. It reads input from a text file, generates prime implicants, identifies essential prime implicants, and produces a minimized Boolean expression. Additionally, it generates a Verilog module based on the minimized expression.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) is required to build the application.
- **Input File Format**: The input file should have three lines:
  1. The number of variables.
  2. Minterms (indicated by 'm')
  3. Don't-care terms (indicated by 'd'), separated by commas.

## Building the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. For example, with GCC:
   ```bash
   // TODO:
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   // TODO:
   ```

## Using the Application

1. 
2. 

## Example Input File

```plaintext
3
m1,m3,m6,m7
d0,d5
```

This example specifies a Boolean function with 3 variables, minterms 1, 3, 6, and 7, and don't-care terms 0 and 5.
